Notes:

The agent seems to be approaching the limits of vanilla MCTS.
Implementing a custom first-play policy seems like a good way to delay exploration of all child nodes.
Move groups might be an interesting avenue to reduce the effective branching factor.
Perhaps also consider 
Played word prefix removal is not implemented.
